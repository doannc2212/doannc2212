#### what i believe in

i think good software comes from curiosity, patience, and caring about the people who use it.
i don't have all the answers, but i enjoy the process of figuring things out — especially with others.

if you're working on something interesting or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out.
i'm always happy to learn from others.
